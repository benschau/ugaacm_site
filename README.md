# UGA ACM WEBSITE
_From small beginnings..._

## Dependencies:
* Ruby On Rails 4.0

## How to use:
1. Clone the repo into any folder.
2. Move into the folder (this can be done at any folder under the main directory).
3. Use rails to create a server to host the website on (locally or otherwise).
4. Profit!

## TODO:
* The site-wide header is non responsive- i.e if the screen is too small, the header will move too far down the page.
* The home page requires more detail- there's nothing on it but a huge picture of some event. 
    * Add buttons at the bottom of the page, with little descriptions.
* The navbar looks and feels disgusting. 
    * Remove the navtitle at the top of the menuwrap, maybe replace it with an icon of some sort.
* Change the overall style:
    * Replace the fonts with something more appealing.
    * Replace the color scheme with something more appealing.
* Use a rails mailer instead of a google form- easier to customize that way.
* Use a different calendar system than google calendar- or, use the google calendar API to make your own calendar.
* In the case of just total crap:
    * Replace it with a [template](https://startbootstrap.com/).
    * Throw all the text, images, files that you need onto it.
    * Hack it enough so it has some flair to it.
* Add route testing.
* Get assets for icons and other images.

## For my successor...
Some tips just for you. I didn't have a predecessor to help me out, and I'd rather not leave you in this with nothing.
* __Know basic web design if you're going to make the site from scratch__- or if you don't/won't, get some inspiration 
from a site that looks good.
* __Don't be held down by Ruby on Rails, if you don't want to use it__- the wordpress site (as of 2017-02-03) is still 
up on the remote server, so don't feel too bad about using it instead of this code base. I lost a good amount of motivation 
working on this, since I was never given either constructive criticism or encouragement working on this, not even a 'hey, how's 
the website coming?' (meaning I just ended up not seeing the point of making it because no one else really seemed to want it in 
the first place). Yes, it's messy and non-organized. Before you decide to work on this, please recognize that you'll probably 
have to do a lot of refactoring. Maybe you want to start from scratch, run with Django instead of Ruby (which, in hindsight, 
would've been a much better idea had I not been asked to work with Ruby instead).
* __Let's be real- you're totally going to go full-stack.__
* __Remember, criticism is both your worst friend and enemy; if you will, worst frienemy.__- Do whatever it takes 
to get it. Communication is not a strong suit of the rest of the exec board (one hell of an understatement) and you should
do your best to tell them what you're up to anyway at the very least. Make absolutely sure they know what the hell you're up to.
* __You can get people to help you out. Make sure they really want to though__- helluva time commitment.
* __Unless you're a super-committed individual, e.g the type that doesn't give something up until you're forced 
to, then you should either make your own agenda or force the exec board to give you one__- If you're like me, you'll 
have to make up what you want to do from scratch. If by the time you're confirmed as an officer, they haven't started making an 
agenda for the board together, then you'll be on your own. Be consistent, commit yourself to this. If it looks like shit, 
own it. If it functions like shit, own it. If it functions and looks amazing, own it.
* Finally, __if the exec board won't help you or refuses to communicate with you explicitly asking for it, 
just give up__. It's not worth working for a team that doesn't care. I would say team, but the truth is you are not much of a 
team if no one knows what the other is doing- or even gives a damn. I have nothing personal against them, though it might seem 
like it. I myself didn't explicitly ask for help, but I do believe I showed enough signs of struggling with web design, sent 
out screenshots of the website, even sent personal texts to the senior execs and got nothing in return. 

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me. 

I wish you best of luck.
