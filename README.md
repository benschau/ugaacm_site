# UGA ACM WEBSITE
_From small beginnings..._

## Dependencies:
* Ruby On Rails 3.0

## How to use:
1. Clone the repo into any folder.
2. Move into the folder (this can be done at any folder under the main directory).
3. Use rails to create a server to host the website on (locally or otherwise).
4. Profit!

## TODO:
* The site-wide header is non responsive- i.e if the screen is too small, the header will move too far down the page.
* The home page requires more detail- there's nothing on it but a huge picture of some event. 
    * Add buttons at the bottom of the page, with little descriptions.
* The navbar looks and feels disgusting. 
    * Remove the navtitle at the top of the menuwrap, maybe replace it with an icon of some sort.
* Change the overall style:
    * Replace the fonts with something more appealing.
    * Replace the color scheme with something more appealing.
* Use a rails mailer instead of a google form- easier to customize that way.
* Use a different calendar system than google calendar- or, use the google calendar API to make your own calendar.
* In the case of just total crap:
    * Replace it with a [template](https://startbootstrap.com/).
